Good Wishes. Thank you for joining us today. We are excited to present our project: ‘Predicting Disasters Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Approach’. My name is Aakarshit Srivastava, and I am joined by my colleagues Ayush Verma and Bhaskar Banerjee."

Let's introduce our team. I am Aakarshit Srivastava, and you can connect with me on LinkedIn. My colleagues Ayush Verma and Bhaskar Banerjee are also available for any professional inquiries. Together, we have collaborated on this innovative project.

Our primary objective is to develop a system capable of predicting both natural and technical disasters using historical and real-time data from the EM-DAT database. Our aim is to enhance disaster preparedness by providing accurate predictions and optimal response strategies."


We used the EM-DAT database, which contains detailed records of over 22,000 mass disasters since 1900, including earthquakes, floods, storms, industrial accidents, and more. This comprehensive data is crucial for understanding disaster trends and impacts.


Data preprocessing is key to accurate predictions. Our process involves data cleaning to address missing values and outliers, feature selection to identify relevant variables like disaster type and location, and data transformation to normalize and encode the data.


We employed several machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy, including Random Forest for its robustness, Gradient Boosting for high accuracy, and Support Vector Machines for handling complex datasets.


In addition, we used deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for temporal dependencies, Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) for remembering longer sequences, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing spatial and temporal data.

Our model training involves splitting the dataset into training and test sets, using cross-validation for tuning, and evaluating models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score to ensure reliability.


Here are some examples of our predictions: For natural disasters like earthquakes, we analyze location and magnitude. For floods, we use weather patterns and historical data. For technical disasters, we predict industrial accidents based on current conditions and transport accidents by examining traffic patterns.

Based on our predictions, we recommend tailored response strategies. For earthquakes, we suggest evacuation plans and structural safety checks. For floods, early warning systems and flood defenses. For industrial accidents, emergency response teams and hazard containment measures, and for transport accidents, rapid response units and traffic management plans.

Thank you for your time and attention. We are confident that our project will contribute significantly to disaster preparedness and response management.
