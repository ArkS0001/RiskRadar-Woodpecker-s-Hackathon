research, Insurance.

cancelled ideas
● Fraud Detection and Prevention System:
Problem Statement: Organizations across various sectors face significant challenges in
detecting and preventing fraudulent activities, leading to substantial financial losses and
reputational damage. Develop an advanced machine learning model leveraging
generative AI technology to analyze patterns and behaviors in data streams. The
objective is to swiftly identify and flag potentially fraudulent activities in real-time and to
proactively prevent such activities by predicting and mitigating risks before they
materialize.
Objective: Enhance security by implementing a sophisticated fraud detection and
prevention system capable of identifying anomalies and suspicious patterns across
diverse datasets. This system should not only detect fraud as it occurs but also predict
and prevent future fraudulent activities by analyzing historical data, customer behaviors,
and transaction patterns using advanced statistical techniques and generative AI.

Problem Statements
● AI-Powered Data Query Interface:
Problem Statement: Organizations often struggle with efficiently accessing and
understanding client data stored in internal databases. Traditional methods of data
retrieval and analysis can be time-consuming and cumbersome, leading to delays in
decision-making and inefficiencies in client management. There is a need for a
streamlined and intuitive solution that allows organization members to query and receive
timely, accurate insights from the database through a user-friendly interface.
Objective: Develop a chat interface that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to
read and interpret client data from an internal database. This interface will enable
organization members to query the database and receive accurate, contextually relevant
responses about the data.
Domain: Not Applicable
● Demand Forecasting Model for Inventory Management:
Problem Statement: Organizations encounter challenges in accurately forecasting
demand, leading to issues like stockouts and excess inventory due to inefficient
inventory management. Objective: Develop forecasting models (univariate and
multivariate) for demand forecasting utilizing historical sales data and market trends to
provide accurate forecasts, thereby improving inventory management and production
planning efficiency.
Domain:Retail, Manufacturing, E-commerce, Consumer Goods, Pharmaceuticals,
Automotive, Healthcare, Technology, Telecommunications, Energy and Utilities, Banking
and Financial Services.
● Predictive Maintenance for Machines:
Problem Statement: Downtime of machinery due to unexpected failures can lead to
inconvenience for customers and increased maintenance costs for the company and
affect sales. Developing a predictive maintenance platform can help anticipate
maintenance needs and prevent unplanned outages.
Objective: Create an analytics platform that predicts when machines will require
maintenance, reducing downtime and improving Performance.
Domain: Automobile, Manufacturing, Logistics, Oil and Gas, Utilities, Healthcare,
Transportation, Mining, Construction, Telecommunications, Power Generation.
