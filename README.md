AI-Based Disaster Prediction and Response System:
Problem Statement: Natural disasters cause significant loss of life and property, and
timely prediction and response are critical to minimizing their impact. Develop an AI
system that predicts natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes using
historical data and real-time inputs, and suggests optimal response strategies.
Objective: Enhance disaster preparedness and response by providing accurate
predictions and actionable insights to emergency responders and affected communities.
Domain: Environmental monitoring, Emergency management, Public safety,
Government agencies, Disaster relief organizations, Infrastructure management, Climate
research, Insurance.
‚óè Fraud Detection and Prevention System:
Problem Statement: Organizations across various sectors face significant challenges in
detecting and preventing fraudulent activities, leading to substantial financial losses and
reputational damage. Develop an advanced machine learning model leveraging
generative AI technology to analyze patterns and behaviors in data streams. The
objective is to swiftly identify and flag potentially fraudulent activities in real-time and to
proactively prevent such activities by predicting and mitigating risks before they
materialize.
Objective: Enhance security by implementing a sophisticated fraud detection and
prevention system capable of identifying anomalies and suspicious patterns across
diverse datasets. This system should not only detect fraud as it occurs but also predict
and prevent future fraudulent activities by analyzing historical data, customer behaviors,
and transaction patterns using advanced statistical techniques and generative AI.
Domain: Financial Services, Insurance, E-commerce, Cybersecurity,
Telecommunications, Healthcare, Government, Retail, Travel and Hospitality, Energy
and Utilities
